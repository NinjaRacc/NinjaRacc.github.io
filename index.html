			<h3>about</h3>
			<p>some words about me go here</p>
			<p>im a really cool genderfluid thing that bounces around the internet, i dabble a little in programming, electrical engineering, *ethical* hacking ;P, 3d printing, paddle boarding and punching nazis 
			<br/>i always have a few projects im working on, right now im working on a modded ender 3 pro, my own 3d printed airsoft designs, and i've started to work on my health by going outside more often, exercising and sticking to a healthier diet :3
			<br/>i'm a huge fan of riot grrrl music, but generally i listen to goth, metal, rock, punk and indie :3 (in no particular order)
			<br/>i'm a big advocate for the right to bear arms (as in firearms), i believe everyone should have the right to defend, well... their rights - and their life. *in the anarchist context.
			<br/>live free or fucking die <br/> stand against tyranny at all costs <br/> armed minorities are harder to oppress <br/> no gods, no masters
